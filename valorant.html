        <h6 class>FunPlus Phoenix</h6>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/FPX_Esports_logo.svg/330px-FPX_Esports_logo.svg.png" alt="FunPlus Phoenix logo">
        <p>FPX has had an odd year so far, to say the least. 
            In Stage 1 Challengers, they secured the first seed in EMEA with fairly one-sided wins over fan favorites such as Team Liquid, Fnatic, and finally a 3-1 over G2 Esports. 
            For the first time ever, FPX would be attending an international event. 
            Unfortunately, they weren’t able to travel due restrictions related to COVID and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. 
            In Stage 2 Challengers, they were still a strong team, but found a familiar foe to be unstoppable: Fnatic. 
            FPX lost three series in a row to Fnatic in qualifiers, and lost a fourth time in Copenhagen this past week. 
            Despite playing with a substitute during the group stage, FPX was able to make it to the playoffs.
            Their success to this point could be attributed to, in a large part, by ardiis' impressive performances.
            So far at Copenhagen, ardiis has the highest average combat score, and the highest average damage per round.
            In the playoffs, the team returned to full strength with SUYGETSU and reached the top four. 
            In their international debut, FPX wants to prove they’re the best team in the world, but first, they’ll have to prove they’re the best EMEA team by defeating Fnatic.

        <p>Fnatic won over fans across the globe with an incredible run at the first ever international LAN at Reykjavík in May of 2021. 
            Despite falling short with a second place finish, Fnatic showed they were a team to watch going forward. 
            Or so we thought. 
            Shortly after, they failed to even qualify for 2021 Stage 3 Masters, and barely managed to qualify to Champions 2021, where they earned a disappointing, but respectable, fifth place. 
            At the 2022 Stage 1 Masters, they fell short of expectations once again with an 11th place finish, though this could be attributed to some last minute COVID-related substitutions. 
            After their loss at Stage 1 Masters, they signed Enzo (formerly Alliance), and 17 year-old superstar Alfajer (formerly Surreal Esports). 
            The team quickly picked up wins over G2, Liquid, and world champions in M3C and Acend. 
            While the five members may not be the exact same as the team that lost in the Grand Finals back in 2021, the team is no less hungry to finally make it back to the Grand Finals and finally be crowned world champions.

        <h6 class>Paper Rex</h6>
        <img src="https://liquipedia.net/commons/images/thumb/3/3c/Paper_Rex_lightmode_full.png/600px-Paper_Rex_lightmode_full.png" height="250" width="250" alt="Paper Rex logo">
        <p>Southeast Asia as a region has been relatively quiet on the international scene. 
            With only 4 teams left, Paper Rex stands as the lone eastern team. 
            This bodes well for PRX as they have not lost a single map to a western team in any of their international appearances. 
            2-0 The Guard. 2-0 G2. 2-0 Guild. 2-0 Fnatic. 
            Can they continue this streak when they face the reigning champions, Optic? 
            With the last 4 international tournaments being split evenly between the two western regions, Paper Rex hopes to be the first team from neither EMEA nor NA to win a VCT LAN. 
            But it’s not just regional pride that drives the team, of course. 
            This is PRX’s third international appearance, and already they’ve outplaced both of their previous appearances, while still in the upper bracket.
            Each player on the team is showing up at this tournament. 
            Jinggg and f0rsakeN are both in the top 4 for Average Combat Score across the entire tournament.
            Mindfreak has the highest KD of any player, as well as the third highest headshot percentage.
            With the way the team has been playing so far this tournament, it’s clear they’ll be unsatisfied with anything but a first place finish.

        <h6 class>OpTic Gaming</h6>
        <img src="https://liquipedia.net/commons/images/thumb/7/79/OpTic_Gaming_lightmode.png/600px-OpTic_Gaming_lightmode.png" height="250" width="250" alt="OpTic Gaming logo">
        <p>I’m not sure there’s anything I can say about OpTic that hasn’t been said before. 
            They’ve qualified for 3 of 4 Masters. 
            They got to the Grand Finals in Berlin in 2021. 
            They won Stage 1 Masters with a 3-0 over Loud. 
            And although the team certainly hasn’t looked perfect this tournament, they’ve shown that they have incredible mental fortitude, staying composed in close maps and coming back from crushing losses, like a 4-13 loss to DRX.
            Their ability to adapt is also noteworthy.
            Since August 2021, OpTic hasn't lose twice in a row to any team, which shows how well they can prepare for any opponent.
            With Victor on Neon, the team is able to put explosive early round pressure on the opposing team, but even more impressive is their ability to <i>convert</i> advantageous situations.
            In their Round 1 match against XSET, OpTic won <i>100%</i> of rounds where they had a numbers advantage, which is insanely impressive.
            As the reigning champions, OpTic has a target on their back. But will that stop the NA titans from being the first two-time chapmions, and doing it in back-to-back LANs?

        <h6 class>Live audience</h6>
        <img src="https://estnn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CSGO-esports.jpg" alt="Esports crowd">
        <p>Valorant was released in June 2020, shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to quarantine and travel restrictions, online competition quickly became the norm. Many of the first regional tournaments were restricted to online only. It wasn’t until Stage 2 Masters Reykjavík in May 2021 that we had an international LAN. But Masters Copenhagen is the first time that an international Valorant tournament will feature a live audience, and as a competitor, it’s a different experience. Of the 20 players left, many of them have experience competing in front of a crowd from other shooters, such as CS:GO, but that can’t be said for all of them. And even for those who have experience, it might still take time to adjust to the environment and the added pressure. From a spectator point-of-view though, it should be exciting to hear the crowd. Personally, many of my most memorable esports moments are only made more memorable with audience reaction, and I have little doubt that the Copenhagen crowd will make for an unforgettable tournament.</p>
